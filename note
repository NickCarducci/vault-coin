  /*Why do economists not consider utility to be the leisure to prefer, or non-monetary research?
  If it is, then the supply and demand curve makes sense.
  Supply and demand is on a matrix of change-rates with a kilter state in the 0x/0y gradient. Macroeconomic productivity is in the 2nd quadrant, the Phillips curve in the 1st, and leisure amortization in the fourth, but your own stackexchange system says:
  Productivity (topic): A measure of efficiency in production for some given set of outputs
  Is this incapacity to reconcile productivity as in microeconomic supply and demand with macroeconomic, (1) an issue of racketeering/disinformation, (2) or a mistake/misinformation?*/

 * This question is about the etymology by the spelling of commodities, and my recent review of Marx (2022) after I studied Political Science with an Economics minor at Johns Hopkins (2015 B.A.) and now I have discovered the declared term Long Term Unemployment.
The director of the program, Lawrence Ball, opens his paper on the subject with the assertion that Hick's model on Keynes' theories claims "[credit is [determinative] of output]'" (sidebar: would the answerer like to define output versus utility?).
I've also discovered honest and direct mechanism design on reading some content here on economics.stackexchange.
Given this logic, how can reconciliation of definitions with a standardized vocabulary not be the equalities of comm-oddities with long term unemployment and thereby capital is verily finance and not commodities?

/*I have been designing software to service payday loans for industry specific royalty contracts since 2018, and have come across the terms direct and honest mechanism design that are unfortunately for all of us terribly complicated for laypeople like myself.
What is wrong with the following summative statement:
A social choice function is either direct royalties or fraudulent. An honest mechanism is blind.
The revelation principal is akin to substitutive supply in supply and demand, to which any inelasticity over demand (with utility as leisure preferred and therefore Phillips curve == Demand curve) until complementary without left over value.
In law, monopolies are ascertained for this effect, 'exclusionary practices', competing with customers or otherwise preventing them from fixed startup costs (reevaluating their own labor as demand to become supply instead of exchange for it).
